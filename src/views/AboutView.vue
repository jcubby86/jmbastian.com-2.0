          I was born in Orem, Utah, and lived there until I was about 3 years
          old. We moved to Montana for about a year to be close to my maternal
          grandparents while my father looked for a new job. After I turned 4
          we moved back to Utah to the city of Clearfield so my dad could
          start his new job. We lived there for nearly 10 years, and then
          another new job brought our family to Washington State. There I
          attended high school and found a love of Computer Science before I
          graduated!

          After graduating High School I chose to serve a two-year mission for
            the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I was assigned to
            serve in Salta, Argentina, and it was a wonderful experience in
            which I was able to learn a lot and help lots of people. I made so
            many new friends and was able to help many people grow their love of
            Christ, while personally growing much closer to him as well.

          In January 2020 I began attending BYU and studying Computer Science.
          In February I met the love of my life, and we were married in the
          Mount Timpanogos Temple in May 2021. I am getting close to finishing
          my undergraduate degree, and I am enjoying every minute of it!
